**SFP-Master** is a free software programmer of optical `SFP modules` for CH341a devices. It can be used to read, write and save SFP module data to the computer. It requires an SFP to I2C adapter. This adapter is used to read and program SFP-module data. It must be inserted into the slot labelled `24xxx` of the CH341a programmer.
